##What is machine learning?
Machine learning is the application of Artificial Intelligence, the objective of machine learning is to allow the computer to learn from experience. It is the intersection of Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability and Calculus.

Machine learning is an intriguing area of study in Computer Science and a fascinating one at that. I have read books by inventor and computer scientist Ray Kurzweil on how we as a civilization might end up creating intelligent machines, It's a wonderful dream, some could say a bit too unrealistic or even dangerous but from the looks of it, the machine learning wave is turning into a tsunami and might expand to something greater. As we are treading to what might be the fourth industrial revolution where Artificial Inteligence and Robotics are used for things like, personal assistance, self driving cars, self driving drones, smart financial systems that help you save money and so much more it is important for us (myself) to understand these systems so I can be better prepared for this future.

This series will be on the mathematical intuition behind the fundamental algorithms in machine learning and how to code them. This will allow you to deeply understand these systems so that you can make better decisions when working with other machine learning libraries. Understanding these systems will allow you to understand the weaknesses of each algorithm and how to improve these systems based on current available data.
